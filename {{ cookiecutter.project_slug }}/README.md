# {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

A project generated by a minimalistic and opinionated Python template.

## Requirements

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)

## Installing

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Configuration

Populate `env/app.env` for your configuration. An example is available at `env/example.env`.

`env/app.env` is not version controlled because this:

- lets different people to use different configs
- avoids exposing sensible configurations, eg passwords

## Running the application

```bash
make run
```

You can now access a local webserver example at http://localhost:8000.

## Running with docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can now access a containerized webserver example at http://localhost:8000.

## Running with kubernetes

```bash
docker build --tag "docker.io/library/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}:latest" .
kubectl apply --filename kubernetes/
```

If you want to see the results, you can use port-forwarding:

```
kubectl port-forward services/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}-service 8000:80
```

And now you can validate your orchestration at http://localhost:8000.
